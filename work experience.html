            <li> June 2020 - present day: BDB EUROPE SRL</li>
            <p>Finance administrator.
            <p>I am dealing with accounts receivables. I am ensuring that the daily cash receipts are being recorded and reconciled against our clients' accounts across four IBA accounts and three currencies: EUR, GBP and USD.<br/></p>
            <p>I am also responsible with keeping credit control at minimum levels, thus making sure that insurers' payment terms are adhered to and the insurance premiums are paid promptly.</p>
            <p>I am keeping communications between our UK based clients and ourselves by emails and sometimes by phone at an efficient level and aiming to sort out queries for clients within 48 hours.</p>
            <p>I am responsible for the month closing procedures for one of our eight companies. I must close the database for the premiums, the accounting software, print and store the bank reconciliations, as well as print and store all the month-end reports.</p><br/>
            <li>November 2016 - June 2020: TRG PLC</li>
            <p>Server/Supervisor</p>
            <p>I was ensuring our guests were greeted at the door and seen to their seats, their order taken and their meals served. I was there for any other needs our guests had and I had to make sure that they were looked after.</p>
            <p>Once I was trained as a supervisor, my responsibility range grew exponentially, as I was now responsible for the health and safety of staff and guests, food and fire safety, as well as stock counting and placing delivery orders to ensure we had plenty of stock for all the items on the menu.</p><br/>
            <li>April 2014 - November 2016: CAFFE NERO</li>
            <p>Barista in training - Store Manager</p>
            <p>Started off as barista in training, learning all the coffee menu and making sure that our customers were served promptly, quick and safe. I was the winner of the internal annual Barista of the Year competition, where I won fourth place in the London region, region consiting of aproximately 200 stores.</p>
            <p>I have completed all of the company's progression steps from barista in training to Barista to Shift Leader to Assistant Manager to Manager in Training until I got to Store Manager.</p>
            <p>I ran my own store for about one year, a year in which I was responsible for a team of eight from recruiting until their own progression. Together with my team we have won the annual prize for Food attachment across the whole of the UK, approximatley 1,000+ stores, prize of which I was extremely proud</p>
