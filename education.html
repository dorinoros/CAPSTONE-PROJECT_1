                <li>Winner of the Business Strategy simulation game. We entered in groups in this global business strategy simulation, where we had to put into practice our knowledge of business strategy and make a wide range of decisions in the game. Each week, we had results of our decisions coming in and we could see where we stand among our competitors. Each week my team and I came into first place with our fictional shoe company, Calletier. At the end of the 6 week simulation, Calletier won the first place and we were invited to enter into the global finals. </li>
